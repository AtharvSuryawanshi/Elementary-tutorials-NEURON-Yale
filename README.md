These tutorials are primarily created for the course MB208: Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience in IISc.

NEURON, a powerful simulation environment for modeling neurons and neuronal networks, can indeed be difficult and complex, especially when starting with the HOC (High-Order Calculator) language. While HOC is as fast as C/C++, it introduces additional difficulty in coding that can at times hinder the understanding of concepts.

Thus, Python a language known for its simplicity and readability. Python provides an elegant alternative for working with NEURON. Here are some key advantages of using Python in conjunction with NEURON:

- Ease of Learning: Python’s straightforward syntax makes it accessible to beginners. It allows us to focus on understanding the neural models rather than grappling with intricate language constructs.
- Rich Ecosystem: Python’s extensive ecosystem includes libraries for scientific computing, data analysis, and visualization. By leveraging these tools, we can enhance our understanding of neural simulations.
- Online Documentation: Python benefits from a wealth of online resources, tutorials, and community support. This availability of documentation aids learners in grasping NEURON concepts more effectively.

In light of these advantages, I have curated a set of basic NEURON tutorials using Python. These tutorials aim to bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation, empowering students to explore computational neuroscience with ease.
