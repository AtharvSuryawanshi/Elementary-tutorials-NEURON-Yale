# Python-tutorials-NEURON-Yale
## Author: Atharv Suryawanshi
These tutorials are primarily created for the course MB208: Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience in IISc.

Understanding and using NEURON is a difficult especially if you start with HOC language. Yes, the language is as fast as C/C++ but we do not code anything that heavy which requires such speeds. 
Meanwhile the added coding complexity hinders understanding of the basics. Python is a very simple language to learn and understand.
While trying to code in Python, I found a significant lack of online documentation to refer to. Thus I have created these basic tutorials of NEURON using Python.
