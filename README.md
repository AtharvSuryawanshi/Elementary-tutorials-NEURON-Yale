# Python-tutorials-NEURON-Yale
## Author: Atharv Suryawanshi
These tutorials are primarily created for the course MB208: Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience in IISc.

Understanding and using NEURON is complex, especially if you start with HOC language. Yes, the language is as fast as C/C++, but we do not code anything that heavy which requires such speeds. Meanwhile, the added coding complexity hinders understanding of the basics. Python is a straightforward language to learn and understand. While trying to code in Python, I found a significant need for online documentation. Thus, I have created these basic NEURON tutorials using Python.
